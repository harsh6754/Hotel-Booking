# Hotel-Moonshine
A fully functioning, menu-driven program for hotel management giving the actual experience of hotel booking by providing the features of room booking, customer records, feedback etc.

The main objective of this menu driven program for the management and handling of the Hotel Moonshine was to basically make room booking and searching for rooms
much more accessible and easier. A menu for the Hotel Moonshine was drafted making use of the function switch case, which made it very easy to manipulate and add as
many options as needed. Through the menu, one could access various options such as room bookings, room allotted, customer records, editing said records and even a feedback form. In the room bookings menu, one could access the
kinds of rooms available with us at the hotel, and their prices per night. There choose the type of room and the number of nights to spend in hotel along with additional services and discounts. In the room allotted menu, check the rooms freely available. In the customer records menu,
customera can make a profile in the program as a customer at the hotel. They can add as many profiles as they like to, and theyâ€™re password protected so as to make things secure. Search up a customer staying at the hotel using the password that the customer saves, again, keeping the security of data of every
customer in mind. The option to edit the records is also available. The facility to give a feedback is also available. Here answer various questions about the stay at the hotel, the staff
and the rooms. 

The purpose to develop this project was to complete a class assignment and to gain hands-on experience in the language.
